# Feature scaling
# -----
# ML models need all features to be on same scale so that some features are not ignored
# Some don't - e.g., in regression, the coefficients we learn will just scale away any scaling in the features do it's not needed
# There are two main scaling techniques:
#Â 1. Standardisation - works well all the time
# Subtract the mean and divide by the standard deviation - makes the mean be close to zero and the SD be close to 1 - so all values between -3 and +3 (because almost whole distr is within 3 SD of mean)
# 2. Normalisation - works well when distr is roughly normal
# Subtract the min and divide by the range - so that numbers fall between 0 and 1
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
standard_scaler = StandardScaler() # Don't need parameters for standarisation

# Do not apply stndardardisation on features tahtt have been encoded because tey're just 1 and 0 and they'll lose their interpretationa and we don't need to becasue they're all between 0 and 1
X_train[:, 3:] = standard_scaler.fit_transform(X=X_train[:, 3:]) # Fit gets teh mean and SD of features and transform applies scaling to X

# Now apply the same scaling to the test set (do DON'T fit again, only transform)
X_test[:, 3:] = standard_scaler.transform(X=X_test[:, 3:])
