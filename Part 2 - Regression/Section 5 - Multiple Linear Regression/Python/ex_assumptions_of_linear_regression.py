Assumptions of Linear Regresssion 
* Linearity 
* Homoscedasticity - equal variance around the mean as you traverse the x axis - i.e., var is not a factor of the x var 
* Multivariate normaility - normal distribution around the mean
* Independence - there is no pattern in our data i.e. not the stock market, where past price ictates future price 
* Predictors should not be correlated
* No serious outliers - if so, then remove
